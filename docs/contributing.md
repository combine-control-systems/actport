# How to contribute to ActPort

If you want to add more block generators, fork the repository and add the relevant Matlab code followed by
a pull request. See the [documentation on how to write block generators](writing-block-generators.md).

To change anything in the data model written in Scala just do the same thing.

If you are unfamiliar with Scala you could install [IntelliJ Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) 
and the Scala Plugin to work with the source code.
Check out your forked code and import the existing code base in IntelliJ. Select sbt. All dependencies should be
downloaded automatically. Read about [building](build-and-install.md).

[Read about Scala](https://docs.scala-lang.org/) and try to follow the 
[style guide](https://docs.scala-lang.org/style/index.html).
